## Examples

Examples **with fake data** can be found in this repository 
[here](https://github.com/SCEDC/ground-motion-packet/tree/main/examples).
These examples are selected to illustrate a number of different possible
instrument configurations and to highlight the value of sensible grouping
of traces into streams. 

[Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCEDC/ground-motion-packet/main/examples/example1.json)
:  This is the simplest example, which is a single 3-component intstrument grouped as
   a stream.

[Borehole Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCEDC/ground-motion-packet/main/examples/borehole_example.json)
:  This is for the downhole geotechnical array at Treasure Island. There are three
   traces at each depth, and each depth is grouped as a stream.
